I have an interest in data and machine learning. My background in mathematics makes it easier for me to understand how machine learning algorithms work, which can help me guess which algorithm should be used. I also often participate in competitions related to it, such as Second Place in Data Science Competition: Predict California House Price in Post Covid by GRMDS and AI Innovation Challenge Finalist by FASILKOM UI.

I also learned a lot about web and android development. For web development itself, I am more interested in the backend because it is more often related to algorithmic logic. For android, I have learned to use Jetpack in projects. I think having these skills will make it easier to implement the machine learning models that have been created. Like in my project with my colleague, namely Ariga.ai: Deep Learning-Based Geometry Guessing Application.

I am very interested in technology! So, I am very open to learning new things about it.
